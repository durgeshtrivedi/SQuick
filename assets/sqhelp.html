<p><b>Overview</b></p>
<p>Squick is an application that allows you to quickly navigate to your most used functions from within any app. Squick is a overlay 
that stays on the screen and is accesible to user at all times. Through a simple swipe gesture user can get to a preconfigured 
set of applications, contacts and can also directly call and a message a contact.

<p><b>Settings</b></p>

<p>> By launching the application from the launcher menu the user can customize the application as desired.</p>

<p>> Squick allows a user to set at-most four quick launch bars on the screen with two quick launch bars on either side of the 
  vertical edges.</p>
  
<p>> Each quick launch bar can be configured to launch </p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>> User has an option to keep the launch bars opaque so that they are visible at all times or make them completely transparent.</p>

<p>> The launch bar thickness can also be customized as per user needs.</p>

<p><b>Configuration</b></p>

<p>> Swipe on the quick launch bars launches a shortcut screen which shows a 4x4 grid, user can then set applications and/or add 
contacts to the direct dial or direct message screen by a long press on the grid items.</p>

<p>> Grid configuration needs to be done only once after which the settings are saved.</p>

<p>> That's it. Happy swiping.</p>
